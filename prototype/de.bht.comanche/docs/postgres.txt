#1 Maven Test can't connect to DB on fresh system restart
---------------------------------------------------------

To make postgres work on startup:
    - Added

    '/usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/pg_ctl start -l logfile -D /usr/local/pgsql/data' to /etc/rc.local

    Which starts up postgres with the specified data folder when system is booted.
    This Was done manually in shell script before.

    - Executed

    ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'postgres';

    with debian user postgres in psql shell (>psql)


ACCESSING POSTGRES FROM OUTSIDE

vi /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf
add 

# VBOX Open Port to Outside world
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               trust

vi /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf
